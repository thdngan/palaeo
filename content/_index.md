>*One could say, in fact, that no story really has a beginning, and that no story really has an end, as all of the world's stories are as jumbled as the items in the arboretum, with their details and secrets all heaped together so that the whole story, from beginning to end, depends on how you look at it.*

>&mdash; Lemony Snicket, The End


Hello there, I'm Ngan (Ryan). Welcome to my [digital arboretum](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up#:~:text=A%20digital%20garden%20is%20an,to%20be%20cultivated%20in%20public.)! This is where I keep track of all of my ideas, notes, discussions, personal projects, and pretty much everything else. These notes may not be polished or final; some are posted as incomplete thoughts that I may revisit later or link to other notes to develop and change over time.

*You might be wondering why there are penguins in an arboretum. Well, I don't know either xD*



# How to navigate

  
You can easily navigate between notes by clicking on internal links within each page or by using the nodes on the interactive graph. If you're on a desktop, the graph is located on the right side of the page, and if you're using a mobile device, you can find it at the bottom of the page. You can also use the search tool 🔍 at the top (or **Ctrl + K**) to look for posts and keywords. Alternatively, you may look at a list of my [topics here](https://thdngan.github.io/quartz/subjects/):

- [[climate n weather|Climate Modelling & Planetary Science]],
- [[astrophysics|Astrophysics]], 
- [[image processing|Signal & Image Processing (just image for now lol)]], 
- [[particle physics|Particle Physics]].

# Acknowledgement


I discovered [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) while searching for a way to publish my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes. I've had so much fun setting up my own garden, *and a little \*coughs\* headache because I was truly a noob at front-end stuff lol*. The results are really worth it though, and I picked up a ton of knowledge along the way. Many thanks to [Jacky Zhao](https://github.com/jackyzha0) for creating this incredible tool!

I wrote blogs across a variety of platforms for a while, but I couldn't settle on one to use consistently. I once decided to write about a [[posts/neutrino communication|neutrino application]] and soon realized that it would be way more effective and intriguing to explain the intricate world of Particle Physics by linking bi-directionally to all the other concepts it's tangled up with. This led me to the idea of publishing my notes using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and during my search, I discovered [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).
